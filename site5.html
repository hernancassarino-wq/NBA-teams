			The Chicago Bulls are an American professional basketball team based in Chicago, Illinois, and are famous for the dynasty built around Michael Jordan, achieving 6 NBA championships.
		</p>
		<p>
			Founding: Established in 1966, the Bulls were the third professional franchise in the city. They debuted strongly, making the playoffs immediately. The 1970s Bulls were known as a tough, defensive team, featuring players like Jerry Sloan, but never reached the Finals.
		</p>
			The Michael Jordan Era (1984–1998): The franchise changed forever in 1984 when they drafted Michael Jordan. The team added key components like Scottie Pippen and Horace Grant, and hired Phil Jackson as coach.
		<p>
			First Three-Peat (1991–1993): They won their first three consecutive titles by defeating the Lakers, Trail Blazers, and Suns. Jordan was the Finals MVP all three times
		</p>
		<p>
			The Return: Jordan retired briefly in 1993 before returning in 1995. The team acquired rebounding specialist Dennis Rodman.
		</p>
		<p>
			Second Three-Peat (1996–1998): The 1995–96 team set a record with a 72–10 regular season, and the Bulls won three more championships against the Seattle SuperSonics and two against the Utah Jazz, completing their second three-peat.
		</p>
		<p>
			Later Eras: Following the dynasty’s breakup in 1998, the team entered a long rebuilding phase.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Derrick Rose Era: The team returned to prominence after drafting Derrick Rose in 2008. Rose became the youngest MVP in 2011, leading the Bulls to the league’s best record. Injuries, however, derailed their championship pursuit.
		</p>
		<p>
			Recent History: The franchise has since focused on rebuilding, centered on players like Zach LaVine and Nikola Vučević, attempting to return to the elite status last held in the Jordan years.
