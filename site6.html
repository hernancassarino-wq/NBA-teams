			The San Antonio Spurs are a professional basketball team based in San Antonio, Texas, founded as the Dallas Chaparrals in the ABA in 1967 before moving to San Antonio in 1973 and adopting the Spurs name. They are one of the most decorated franchises in NBA history, having won five NBA championships.
		</p>
		<p>
			Founding: Established in 1966, the Bulls were the third professional franchise in the city. They debuted strongly, making the playoffs immediately. The 1970s Bulls were known as a tough, defensive team, featuring players like Jerry Sloan, but never reached the Finals.
		</p>
			The Admiral Era (1989–1997): Center David Robinson, drafted in 1987 but delayed by Navy service, joined in 1989, instantly leading a resurgence. In 1994, the team acquired Dennis Rodman, though his turbulent tenure ended two years later. After an injury-plagued 1996–97 season, the Spurs landed the first overall pick.
		<p>
			The Tim Duncan Era & Dynasty (1997–2016):
		</p>
		<p>
			The Twin Towers: The Spurs drafted Tim Duncan in 1997. Alongside Robinson, the "Twin Towers" led the team to its first NBA title in 1999 (a lockout-shortened season), defeating the New York Knicks.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Big Three: With Robinson's retirement in 2003, the team was led by the legendary trio of Duncan, French point guard Tony Parker, and Argentinian shooting guard Manu Ginóbili, coached by Gregg Popovich. This core won four more championships: 2003, 2005, 2007 (where Parker was the first European Finals MVP), and 2014.
		</p>
		<p>
			Succession: In 2014, Kawhi Leonard was named Finals MVP for defeating the Miami Heat, signaling a planned transition. Duncan retired in 2016.
		</p>
		<p>
			Post-Duncan Era: Leonard took the reins but was traded in 2018. The franchise entered a new phase, maintaining a commitment to Popovich and the development of young players.
